    <h2>My current work</h2>

    <p>I work as the lead engineer for <a href="https://maybe.co">Maybe Finance Inc.</a>, where we're building an all-in-one operational platform for fractional CFOs. This is a recent pivot (July 2025) from the <a href="https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe">OSS personal finance app</a> that I built and maintained for several years (see "Past work").</p>

    <h2>Past Work</h2>

    Projects that I previously worked on or that I'm not actively working to grow.

    <h3>Maybe Finance (OSS personal finance app)</h3>

    <p>There is a long, rollercoaster story behind this one. I initially worked on the Maybe personal finance app from 2021 to early 2023 as the lead engineer. We built an outstanding product but failed to grow revenue fast enough to stay in business and the company had to shut the doors. A year after shutting down, the founder open-sourced the prior work (with permission of the team of course!), went viral on Github, raised another round of funding, and hired me back on to try for a second time. The second attempt saw significant traction in the self-hosted OSS community right out of the gates. After ~1 year of development (and 1/2 the team size as before), we had surpassed 50k stars on Github and amassed over 2M package downloads in less than a year. While this traction was exciting and kept me up around the clock as the lead maintainer, it resulted in significant self-hoster adoption, yet still not enough commercial adoption to keep going. In July 2025, the company made the difficult decision against limited runway to pivot to a B2B offering for the new and quickly growing market of fractional CFOs, which is what I'm currently working on.</p>

    <p>This has been a bittersweet project for me. I still use the OSS version of Maybe for my own personal finances (self-hosted of course!) and truly believe that given a long enough stretch of runway we had something pretty special here. Fintech is a tough game!</p>

    <h3>The DIY Golfer</h3>

    <p>While I've had far less time to play in recent years, golf has always been a big part of my life. I played
        collegiate golf for The University of Akron from 2013-2017 and had the privilege to see some of the most
      beautiful
      places on earth and compete against some of the best college golfers in the country. It was an incredible
      experience.</p>

    <p>During my time as a collegiate golfer, I created <a href="https://www.thediygolfer.com">The DIY Golfer</a>, a
      golf blog turned golf instructional website that I've been running since 2015. Due to other priorities, I have stopped actively adding content to this site, but it remains a valuable resource visited by hundreds of golfers every day alongside its accompanying YouTube channel.</p>

    <h3>Local Golf Spot</h3>

    <p>In 2022, I started <a href="https://www.localgolfspot.com">Local Golf Spot</a>, a website dedicated to
      helping golfers find the best golf courses in their area, plan golf trips, and get unbiased rankings/reviews from local golfers. Similar to The DIY Golfer, I consider this a passion project and while I don't have immediate commercial plans for it, the recent advancements in LLM models / agent workflows has brought a renewed sense of interest to this project for me when I have some free time to hack on it. While a golf course directory on the surface, this project has been an interesting intersection between statistical modeling and LLM agent workflows / data pipelines.</p>

    <h3>Full Stack Foundations</h3>

    <p>My <a href="https://www.youtube.com/{{ site.youtube_username }}">web development YouTube channel</a> has reached
      2M+ students and I have helped several land jobs in tech and develop a passion for writing code. <a href="https://www.fullstackfoundations.com">Full Stack Foundations</a> is a website I created to host all of
      my web development tutorials in one spot.</p>

    <p>While I still have a passion for writing software, I've stopped actively creating content for this site. With the recent advancements in AI, I no longer believe that hand-written, detailed software tutorials are the best way for me to teach this craft and I think there is a declining cohort of students with an appetite for this medium of learning. My future plans for this site is to keep it as the home base for any high-level technical articles I write, but not as a platform that I'm actively trying to grow.</p>
